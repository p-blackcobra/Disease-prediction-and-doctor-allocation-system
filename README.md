# Disease-prediction-and-doctor-allocation-system
Aim of this minor project is to predict the disease based on symptoms given by patient and allocate best doctor for that disease according to the patient reviews. It might have happened so many times that you or someone yours need doctors help immediately, but they are not available due to some reason. The Health Prediction system is an end user support and online consultation project. The system is fed with various symptoms and the disease/illness associated with those systems. The system allows user to share their symptoms and issues. It then processes user’s symptoms to check for various illnesses that could be associated with it. Here we use some intelligent data mining techniques to guess the most accurate illness that could be associated with patient’s symptoms.
