Causes

Incidentally, both Dengue and Chikungunya are caused by Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes, two species that are playing havoc in the country. It is transmitted from one person to another with the bite of the female specie of the mosquito. These mosquitoes are known to typically bite during the daylight hours. During the daylight hours, the risk of getting bitten is the highest at two points of time, early morning and late afternoon. Though, typically these mosquitoes are known to bite outdoors, aedes aegypti can also bite indoors.

Prevention

If the place of your residence is close to mosquito vector breeding sites, it is a very big risk factor not only for chikungunya but other mosquito borne diseases as well. In such cases, government intervention and steps to ensure minimum risk are needed. Any natural or artificial sites that contain water and support mosquito breeding need effective and frequent insecticide treatments. Flying mosquitoes should be sprayed over and insecticides should be applied to surfaces of the containers and nearby objects. Also, if the proximity of the site and any place of residence is more than it should be, the government needs to ensure that the community is moved somewhere else.

Besides steps which must be taken at the level of authorities, there are many personal steps which you must take. Here are a few tips by Dr Narendra Prasad, consultant, General Medicines, Columbia Asia Hospital, to protect yourself from Chikungunya:

- Keep yourself covered and minimize skin exposure
- Exposed skin should be protected by applying skin repellents
- Keep a check on your surroundings
- Don't let water accumulate
- Stay extra safe during daytime
- use nets to avoid mosquito bites
- Keep your surroundings clean and check for overflowing garbage bins
- Change the water in flower vessels regularly to avoid mosquito breeding
- Keep your toilet seats down when not in use
- Shower daily and use unscented shampoos. Mosquitos are believed to be attracted to smells like perfume and sweat
- Purchase mosquito repellent that contains DEET, especially if you have a balcony garden.
