Causes

It's not known what causes schizophrenia, but researchers believe that a combination of genetics, brain chemistry and environment contributes to development of the disorder.

Problems with certain naturally occurring brain chemicals, including neurotransmitters called dopamine and glutamate, may contribute to schizophrenia. Neuroimaging studies show differences in the brain structure and central nervous system of people with schizophrenia. While researchers aren't certain about the significance of these changes, they indicate that schizophrenia is a brain disease.







Risk factors

Although the precise cause of schizophrenia isn't known, certain factors seem to increase the risk of developing or triggering schizophrenia, including:

    Having a family history of schizophrenia
    Increased immune system activation, such as from inflammation or autoimmune diseases
    Older age of the father
    Some pregnancy and birth complications, such as malnutrition or exposure to toxins or viruses that may impact brain development
    Taking mind-altering (psychoactive or psychotropic) drugs during teen years and young adulthood








Complications

Left untreated, schizophrenia can result in severe problems that affect every area of life. Complications that schizophrenia may cause or be associated with include:

    Suicide, suicide attempts and thoughts of suicide
    Self-injury
    Anxiety disorders and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)
    Depression
    Abuse of alcohol or other drugs, including tobacco
    Inability to work or attend school
    Legal and financial problems and homelessness
    Social isolation
    Health and medical problems
    Being victimized
    Aggressive behavior, although it's uncommon












Prevention

There's no sure way to prevent schizophrenia, but sticking with the treatment plan can help prevent relapses or worsening of symptoms. In addition, researchers hope that learning more about risk factors for schizophrenia may lead to earlier diagnosis and treatment.
