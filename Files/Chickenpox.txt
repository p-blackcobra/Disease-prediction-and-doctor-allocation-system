Causes

Chickenpox infection is caused by a virus. It can spread through direct contact with the rash. It also can spread when a person with the chickenpox coughs or sneezes and you inhale the air droplets.









Risk factors

Chickenpox, which is caused by the varicella-zoster virus, is highly contagious, and it can spread quickly. The virus is transmitted by direct contact with the rash or by droplets dispersed into the air by coughing or sneezing.

Your risk of catching chickenpox is higher if you:

    -Haven't had chickenpox
    -Haven't been vaccinated for chickenpox
    -Work in or attend a school or child care facility
    -Live with children

Most people who have had chickenpox or have been vaccinated against chickenpox are immune to chickenpox. If you've been vaccinated and still get chickenpox, symptoms are often milder, with fewer blisters and mild or no fever. A few people can get chickenpox more than once, but this is rare.












Complications

Chickenpox is normally a mild disease. But it can be serious and can lead to complications or death, especially in high-risk people. Complications include:

    -Bacterial infections of the skin, soft tissues, bones, joints or bloodstream (sepsis)
    -Dehydration
    -Pneumonia
    -Inflammation of the brain (encephalitis)
    -Toxic shock syndrome
    -Reye's syndrome for people who take aspirin during chickenpox

Who's at risk?

Those at high risk of having complications from chickenpox include:

    -Newborns and infants whose mothers never had chickenpox or the vaccine
    -Adults
    -Pregnant women who haven't had chickenpox
    -People whose immune systems are impaired by medication, such as chemotherapy, or another disease, such as cancer or HIV
    -People who are taking steroid medications for another disease or condition, such as children with asthma
    -People taking drugs that suppress their immune systems













Prevention

The chickenpox (varicella) vaccine is the best way to prevent chickenpox. Experts from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimate that the vaccine provides complete protection from the virus for nearly 98 percent of people who receive both of the recommended doses. When the vaccine doesn't provide complete protection, it significantly lessens the severity of the disease.

The chickenpox vaccine (Varivax) is recommended for:

    =Young children. In the United States, children receive two doses of the varicella vaccine — the first between ages 12 and 15 months and the second between ages 4 and 6 years — as part of the routine childhood immunization schedule. The vaccine can be combined with the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine, but for some children between the ages of 12 and 23 months, the combination may increase the risk of fever and seizure from the vaccine. Discuss the pros and cons of combining the vaccines with your child's doctor.
    =Unvaccinated older children. Children ages 7 to 12 years who haven't been vaccinated should receive two catch-up doses of the varicella vaccine, given at least three months apart. Children age 13 or older who haven't been vaccinated should also receive two catch-up doses of the vaccine, given at least four weeks apart.
    =Unvaccinated adults who've never had chickenpox but are at high risk of exposure. This includes health care workers, teachers, child care employees, international travelers, military personnel, adults who live with young children and all women of childbearing age. Adults who've never had chickenpox or been vaccinated usually receive two doses of the vaccine, four to eight weeks apart. If you don't remember whether you've had chickenpox or the vaccine, a blood test can determine your immunity.

If you've had chickenpox, you don't need the chickenpox vaccine. A case of the chickenpox usually makes a person immune to the virus for life. It's possible to get chickenpox more than once, but this isn't common. However, if you're older than 60, talk to your doctor about the shingles vaccine.

The chickenpox vaccine isn't approved for:

    -Pregnant women
    -People with weakened immunity, such as those with HIV or people taking immune-suppressing medications
    -People who are allergic to gelatin or the antibiotic neomycin

Talk to your doctor if you're unsure about your need for the vaccine. If you're planning on becoming pregnant, consult with your doctor to make sure you're up to date on your vaccinations before conceiving a child.
Is it safe and effective?

Parents typically wonder whether vaccines are safe. Since the chickenpox vaccine became available, studies have consistently found it safe and effective. Side effects are generally mild and include redness, soreness, swelling and, rarely, small bumps at the site of the shot.
